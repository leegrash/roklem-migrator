' Changes made:
' - Verified that the class inherited from NodesoftBaseController, which should be compatible with .NET Core.
' - Checked that the HttpGet attribute is used correctly for routing.
' - Confirmed that the GetXml function returns IActionResult, as required in ASP.NET Core.
' - Ensured that the File method is correctly used to return the file as IActionResult.
' - The project file should be updated to ensure it references Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc version 6.0.0 or higher for proper builds.
