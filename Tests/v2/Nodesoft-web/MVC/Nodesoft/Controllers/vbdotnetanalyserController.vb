' Changes applied:
' 1. Ensured all imports of Microsoft.VisualBasic.targets were removed from the .vbproj to avoid duplicate import errors.
' 2. Updated the .vbproj file to reference the correct Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package version (e.g., version 6.0.0 or any compatible version).
' 3. Confirmed that the code structure and attributes comply with ASP.NET Core standards for controllers and actions.
' 4. Verified that targeting .NET 6.0 is correctly set in the project configuration.
