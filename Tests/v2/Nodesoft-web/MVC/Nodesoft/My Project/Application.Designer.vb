' 4. Ensure that all client-side validation now uses ASP.NET Core's built-in features.

' Fixed project file references to net6.0
' Ensure project file (Nodesoft.vbproj) has the correct TargetFramework set to net6.0
' Remove any references to incompatible packages: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc that target net40

' Further migration of existing UI components to Razor Pages or alternative frameworks is required depending on specific UI functionality.
