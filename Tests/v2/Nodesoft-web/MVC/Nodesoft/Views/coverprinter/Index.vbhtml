        <p>Cover printer automatically scales images to the correct size of the cover type selected. Some cover types use one image and some two.</p>
        <p>Here we have selected a full image to be printed as a DVD cover.</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/coverprinter/1.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>Add an image by dragging it to the image location or browse for it by clicking on the … button.</p>
        <p>Use the preview function to view a preview of the printout.</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/coverprinter/2.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>As you can see the image is stretched to cover the full DVD cover.</p>
        <p>If you have separate images for back and front you can select a cover type that supports this.</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/coverprinter/3.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>This cover type allows you to add a title for the spine.</p>
        <p>A preview of the two images DVD cover:</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/coverprinter/4.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>A preview of the two images CD cover:</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/coverprinter/5.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>Image rotation is possible with the rotating arrows below the image.</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/coverprinter/6.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>If you have a full DVD cover but would like to use it on a double DVD or slim DVD cover, you can use the predefined spine stretching functions. This only stretches/shrinks the spine.</p>
