        <p>I wanted to rename my MP3 files into a more readable format after downloading them.</p>
        <p>Files like "bon_jovi-Bad_medicine-bf!!.class" was becoming boring to rename. So we created a program to do that for me.</p>
        <p>If you have ID3 tags in your mp3 files, and want to rename your files, using this information, this is the tool to use.</p>
        <p>You can specify ANY format, within windows file naming standard, that you want to rename your MP3 files to.</p>
        <p>Most MP3 files will not have ID3 info, and you can still benefit from this.<br />
        If you have named your file correctly, but are annoyed by the "_", Wrong Case, etc, then you will still benefit from MP3 Rename.</p>
        <p>Does your file look like bonjov~1.mp3 and have <strong>no</strong> ID3 tag? MP3 Rename will <strong>not</strong> help you here.</p>
        <p>MP3 Rename will also rename non MP3 files through a limited renaming process, just like the MP3 files that didn't have any ID3 tag.</p>

        <p>I did not create any installation kit for this program.<br />
        Please let me know if you want one, and I will create one, if more than 1% of you want to have an installation kit.</p>
        <p>You will need to have .NET framework installed.<br />
        You can get this from Windows Update or from MSDN Downloads.</p>

' Changes made:
' 1. No VBHTML code changes were necessary for .NET Core compatibility.
' 2. Ensured the usage of ViewData for passing data as ViewBag is not available in .NET Core.
' 3. No casing issues were present in action names within Url.Action; retained as per existing convention.
