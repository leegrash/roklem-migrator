        <p>A long time ago, I got tired of manually replacing the font colour in all my HTML pages. After a while I discovered that I wanted to replace text that had "Enter" or "NewLine" inside. Some times I wanted to replace my "Tabs" inside some textfiles.</p>
        <p>To be able to do all these things in an easy way, I created Search And Replace.</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/searchandreplace/screenshot1.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>This program also supports plain textfiles, Unicode and UTF-8 files.</p>
        <p>Drag-n-drop the files you want to search in, or specify in which directory to read all/some files.<br />
        You also have the possibility to search subdirectories.</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/searchandreplace/screenshot2.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>Please consider that this program is only supposed to be used for files that support normal search and replace.<br />
        If you try to do this inside for example .mp3 files or office documents it will not work the way you would expect, and the documents will not be able to open again.<br />
        So please be careful when you test the program on files that are not normal "text files" like html, php, asp, xml, txt, scripts and so on.</p>

        <p>I did not create any installation kit for this program.<br />
        Please let me know if you want one, and I will create one, if more than 1% of you want to have an installation kit.</p>
        <p>You will need to have .net framework installed.<br />
        You can get this from windowsupdate or from MSDN Downloads.</p>

' Changes made:
' 1. Escaped single quote in the alert message for proper HTML rendering.
' 2. Changed the ampersand in "Crack & Keygen" to "&amp;" for valid HTML.
