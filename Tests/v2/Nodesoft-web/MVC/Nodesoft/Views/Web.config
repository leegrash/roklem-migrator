<!-- Migration changes:
1. Removed the <configuration> section as it's not needed in .NET Core; configuration is managed through appsettings.json.
2. Removed all references to System.Web.Mvc, as ASP.NET Core uses a different MVC architecture.
3. Updated the project file Nodesoft.vbproj to include the correct package references using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc version >6.0.0.
4. Ensured that the target framework in Nodesoft.vbproj is correctly set to net6.0.
5. Addressed the import error for Microsoft.VisualBasic.targets in Nodesoft.vbproj by ensuring no duplicate imports.
6. Updated package references in the .vbproj file to avoid NU1102 errors regarding package availability and ensured proper versioning of libraries is adhered to.
