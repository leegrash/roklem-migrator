        <p>When I write code I often wonder how many lines of code is this... really?<br />
        How many empty lines are there in my project?<br />
        Well my curiosity was bigger than my laziness so I started working in VB.Net Analyzer.</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/vbdotnetanalyser/screenshot.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>Right now all it does is count lines of code in a solution. (Total number of line, lines of code…)</p>
        <p>If you like it please tell me what more to put into it! I’m planning lists of classes, functions etc.<br />
        Maybe even unused local variables.</p>

        <p>I did not create any installation kit for this program.<br />
        Please let me know if you want one, and I will create one, if more than 1% of you want to have an installation kit.</p>
        <p>You will need to have .net framework installed.<br />
        You can get this from Windows Update or from MSDN Downloads.</p>

        <p>The tool is completely free!</p>
