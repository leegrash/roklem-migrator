        <p>So I created this program that will read IIS log files (only W3C format).</p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/iislogfileanalyser/screenshot1.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p><img src="@Url.Content("~/content/images/iislogfileanalyser/screenshot2.png")" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
        <p>It will give statistics/information on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many hits all zip files that you have (or any other file that you specify)</li>
            <li>How many visitors you have per day, week, hour</li>
            <li>Where your visitors were just before they went to your site (referrers).</li>
            <li>How many pages each visitor is looking at.</li>
            <li>How many different values you have per query value (for ASP and other)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I did not create any installation kit for this program.<br />
        Please let me know if you want one, and I will create one, if more than 1% of you want to have an installation kit.</p>
        <p>You will need to have .NET Core 6.0 Runtime installed.<br />
        You can get this from the official Microsoft website.</p>
