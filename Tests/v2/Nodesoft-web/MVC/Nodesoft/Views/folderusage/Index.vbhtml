        <p>Which of my folders are using the most space?<br />
        Are there folders that use much diskspace that I don't know of?<br />
        Why is C drive running out of disk space?</p>
        <p>I wanted the answers to these questions, and most programs that I found out there were too expensive for me.<br />
        And the free programs could not do what I wanted them to.</p>

        <p>Please e-mail me about suggestions.</p>
        <p>I did not create any installation kit for this program.<br />
        Please let me know if you want one, and I will create one, if more than 1% of you want to have an installation kit.</p>
        <p>You will need to have .net core installed.<br />
        You can get this from the official Microsoft website.</p>
