<!-- Changes made:
1. Verified and ensured there are no duplicate resources in the VB project to avoid build errors.
2. Removed the `listeners` section completely, as .NET Core uses a different logging approach (built-in logging frameworks).
3. Ensured proper configuration structure to maintain necessary elements for potential diagnostics without causing conflicts.
4. Checked for duplicate resource files within the project that might be causing the build error (MSB3577) to ensure unique output paths.
